            I am a current graduate student at Duke University enrolled in the Game Design, Development, and Innovation masters program. I am excited about combining the worlds of technology and writing to explore new frontiers of storytelling and create games and other media that will inspire people. My experience with both game programming and writing will allow me to take on a variety of roles in the games industry. I also have experience working with emerging technologies such as machine learning, and I am always trying to learn more about the newest developments in the tech world! I am currently looking for internships and entry-level positions that will give me the opportunity to work on creative projects within the tech world.

What I'm working on right now:
-Developing C++ skills
-Development in game engines (Unreal/Godot)
